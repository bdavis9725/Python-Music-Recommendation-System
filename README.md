## The Intelligent Recommendation Service
This repo holds the code for parts 1 and 2 of my project in the PCP module of my MSc in Big Data Analytics course at Sheffield Hallam University.

Part 1 involves using concepts of Python without using libraries to create a system can find the similarity of two songs chosen by the user and output the similarity score.

Part 2 involves using OOP concepts to create a system that provides n most similar tracks to a user based their selection / entry. The value of n is chosen by the user.

UI Image for Part is located here, it will changed to a gif later.
